## Code language: English

Code shared by every tenant is written in **English**: identifiers, comments,
docstrings, log messages and test names. This applies to this repository.

What citizens and staff read stays in their language, but it lives outside the
code: i18n files, notification templates and user-facing messages (UI text,
API error details shown to users).

Tenant-specific code (`tenants/<id>/` and each tenant's workflow repository)
may follow the tenant's own language. Existing Spanish code in shared
repositories is migrated as it is touched, not in bulk.
