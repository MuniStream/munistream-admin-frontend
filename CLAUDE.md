### Test Users
- admin / admin123 (Admin role - all permissions)
- manager / manager123 (Manager role)
- reviewer / reviewer123 (Reviewer role)
- approver / approver123 (Approver role)

### Key Technical Decisions
- Material-UI v7 for component library
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- TypeScript for type safety
- Docker containerization
- JWT authentication integration
- Mermaid.js for workflow visualization

### Development Standards
1. **Use Material-UI Components** - Always use MUI components for consistency
2. **TypeScript Strict Mode** - All components must be properly typed
3. **React Query** - Use for all API calls and data management
4. **Component Organization** - Keep components modular and reusable
5. **Responsive Design** - All interfaces must work on desktop and tablet
6. **Authentication Required** - All admin routes must be protected
7. **Error Handling** - Proper error boundaries and user feedback
8. **Testing** - Unit tests for critical components
9. **Never Commit CLAUDE.md** - NEVER commit CLAUDE.md files to any repository

### Dependencies
- Requires backend API endpoints for citizen validation features
- Integration with civicstream-workflow repository APIs
